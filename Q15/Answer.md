The provided Python code solves the real-world fuzzy join problem by combining external sorting with string similarity scoring. First, each large CSV file is split into sorted chunks based on the join key (name or university_name) using pandas. This simulates external sorting, which is necessary when the tables are too large to fit into memory. After sorting, the fuzzy_merge function iterates through the sorted rows and compares each pair using fuzz.token_sort_ratio from the RapidFuzz library. This function computes a similarity score between two strings, allowing matches like "Laurier" and "Wilfrid Laurier University" to be considered similar if their score exceeds a defined threshold (e.g. 35). This approach solves the problem by mimicking a sort-merge join process while relaxing the strict equality condition to allow approximate key matching. Instead of requiring exact string equality, the code accepts pairs of rows whose keys are "close enough" according to fuzzy logic.
